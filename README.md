## Description
   This application is a personalized festival using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a Sequelize ORM. The MVC design pattern was utilized in combination with Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

## Installation
* Begin by cloning the repo locally.
* Using the CLI, the user should navigate to the project directory and run 'npm install'.
* Use MySQL for database handling.
* Start the database using the provided schema.sql to be copied into MySQL.
* The user will need to register for a google api key. Best practices are to restric the api key to be used only on for the YouTube Data Api.

## Usage
* For locally hosted: 
  After installation, the user should navigate to the project directory and run 'node server.js' in the CLI, then navigate to http:localhost:8080
